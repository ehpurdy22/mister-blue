abstract = {In 1998, the remains of a sequence of seventeenth-century emblematic wall-paintings were discovered in a house in York. The paintings' reproduction of images from Francis Quarles's Emblemes (1635), rarely used in domestic decoration in the period, prompts a series of questions about the identity of the paintings' commissioner, their private and public use, and how viewers were to understand the relationship between word and image in the paintings' depiction of the soul's anguished relationship with God. In providing preliminary discussion around each of these questions, this essay places the York paintings in the wider context of domestic decoration in early modern England and focuses on the complex set of relationships between householder, painting, and viewer, and between the wall-paintings and their literary and biblical sources.},

abstract = {Nineteen natural specimens of azurite from European mining locations used in medieval times were analysed by Raman microscopy to investigate the existence and identity of any impurities. Malachite, hematite, goethite and other commonly occurring minerals such as cuprite, rutile and anatase were detected in a significant proportion of the specimens. Other minerals detected, albeit less frequently, include quartz, calcite, cerussite, orthoclase, beudantite and jarosite. These findings indicate that any iron oxides and malachite detected as minor impurities in azurite-containing museum objects should be taken as a consequence of the natural make-up of azurite specimens used for the pigments rather than a deliberate addition by the artist. Furthermore, the apparently sensible assumption that black and orange-brown impurities in azurite pigments are mainly copper oxides (cuprite and tenorite) is incorrect as these particles actually correspond to the iron oxides, goethite and hematite. It is possible with considerable further work that the concurrent association of the less common impurities within a single pigment sample might help to ascertain the provenance of an individual azurite-containing pigment by relating it to a known historic azurite source. If such a provenance study was carried out, we expect specific localization of an azurite pigment would only be possible if a source region or mine is known to contain azurite with particularly exotic or unusual composition.},

@article{Baird_thesis,
abstract = {Wall paintings survive in many houses dating from the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries yet, apart from recording the phenomenon, there has been very little written about them. This research explores how common wall paintings were, what sort of houses had them, when they were painted and most importantly, what was their significance in terms of what they can reveal about the lives of the people who chose to decorate their homes in this manner. Research has concentrated on the Welsh Marches although examples from elsewhere have been referred to. The research hypotheses are: 1. Wall paintings were much more widespread than existing records suggest and were probably universal where there was money to spend on embellishing a house. 2. Following on from this, wall paintings would have been found in houses throughout the social scale, apart from the humblest dwellings. 3. The paintings were executed by itinerant painters who used pattern books as a source of design. 4. This form of decoration was most commonly found in the period 1550-1625, with few paintings prior to this date and a rapid decline in numbers after this period. 5. In some cases there is a connection between the content of the painting and the function of the room. The fifth hypothesis was widened during the course of the research to examine the significance of wall paintings generally. In trying to find out what wall paintings signified to the owners of houses, this research has attempted to look at all the facets of their life and environment which may have a bearing on this. This includes an understanding of the buildings themselves, exploring who the people were who might have lived in them and placing these people in their social and cultural contexts. Always the emphasis has been on the small and local rather than on the bigger picture. as this is what touched people at the vernacular level most closely. In order to do this, the research has adopted a wide-ranging and multidisciplinary approach which cuts across traditional fields of knowledge. Therefore, the study combines library and documentary-based evidence with extensive fieldwork, in order to investigate diverse kinds of evidence. This includes research on the wall paintings themselves, the buildings in which they were found and the social, religious and cultural circumstances in which they were created. The research synthesises a wide range of methods for gathering and interpreting data: study and analysis of contemporary literature and documents, the study of a wide range of published and unpublished research, and a substantial fieldwork survey. First the context in which wall paintings were created is explored, in terms of physical environment, cultural and social characteristics of the period, and the church. Then the key findings arising from the fieldwork are discussed, looking at the sorts of houses that have wall paintings, the people who lived in them, and in detail at the characteristics of the paintings found. 233 wall paintings were recorded in 188 buildings. The hypotheses about universality and status are explored by investigating the vernacular qualities of wall painting in terms of materials and techniques required, who was doing the paintings, and their cost. Through the identification of a range of iconography, and the classification of paintings, possible sources for wall painting designs are explored. Finally the key issue of the significance of painted decoration at the vernacular level is discussed drawing on the various strands of the research in order to understand why particular forms of decoration might have been chosen, and what social and cultural meanings they may have had. The findings of the research indicate that wall paintings were very widespread. They were found throughout the area of study in houses of all but the very poor. Whilst the majority of paintings surveyed were in houses of the gentry or better-off members of society it is argued that this reflects the differential rate of survival of vernacular buildings. A technical analysis of wall paintings and an assessment of their total cost reveals the vernacular qualities of the wall paintings. This also suggests that wall paintings were only ever intended as short term decoration as some of the pigments used were very fugitive. Further evidence for this has been found in the practice of overpainting one scheme with another within a short period, which was revealed through microscopic analysis of paint samples. The contemporary aesthetic included striking yet crude designs which were capable of being executed by local craftsmen. These findings indicate that wall paintings could have been extensive lower down the social scale. Whilst painted decoration throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was examined, it is submitted that the majority of paintings were executed during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries - a period of considerable change during the transition from a medieval to an early modern society. The paintings dating from this period have a character quite distinct from the limited number found earlier and later than this period. The significance of wall paintings is closely bound up with issues of status. This period of transition was characterised by outward expressions of status by means of display in a variety of forms. It is argued in this research that wall paintings were an element of such display. Iconography included decorative as well as figure subjects and it is this that holds the key to the significance of the paintings. The higher status houses had the more complex figurative and ornamental schemes whilst, for the most part, the humbler houses had simpler ornamental schemes. Also the simpler, decorative schemes seem to have been more common in halls whilst more sophisticated paintings appear to have been in the more private rooms of the house. The iconography and the context of the wall paintings can provide an important insight into some of the more intangible and elusive aspects of vernacular life. Social and cultural values of the period are particularly difficult to access as surviving indicators of these are limited. Literary sources have limited value in a society which expressed itself in a predominantly non-literate fashion. Vernacular buildings can provide a major source of information and this research argues that wall paintings were a key element in vernacular buildings at a specific time during the transition from a medieval to an early modern society and are, therefore, a crucial record of changing social and cultural values.},

abstract = {This essay investigates the relationship between color and contingency in Robert Boyle's Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours (1664) and his essays on the unsuccessfulness of experiments in Certain Physiological Essays (1661). In these two works Boyle wrestles with a difficult practical and philosophical problem with experiments, which he calls the problem of contingency. In Touching Colours, the problem of contingency is magnified by the much-debated issue of whether color had any deep epistemic importance. His limited theoretical principle guiding him in Touching Colours, that color is but modified light, further exacerbated the problem. Rather than theory, Boyle often relied on craftsmen, whose mastery of color phenomena was, Boyle mentions, brought about by economic forces, to determine when colors were indicators of important 'inward' properties of substances, and thus to secure a solid foundation for his experimental history of color.},

The first one is a copper-based pigment; the coloring compound of the latter is lazurite, a sodium silico-aluminate in a sulfur matrix. Knowledge of the chemical composition of the materials is essential for the study of illuminated manuscripts. In this paper, micro-Raman and LIBS have been used for the study of azurite and lapis-lazuli, as well as different mixtures of these pigments applied to parchment to simulate an illuminated manuscript. The results of our work show the importance of using more than one technique for a good comprehension of a manuscript. In particular, the opportunity of combining elemental information (obtained from laser induced breakdown spectroscopy) and vibrational spectroscopy information (obtained from Raman) will be fully exploited. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the role played by pigment particle size in pigment-binder interactions, and thus susceptibility to aging of azurite-rabbit glue paint dosimeters upon accelerated UV-aging versus outdoor sunlight exposure. A complementary multi-analytical approach, including spectroscopic and surface analytical techniques, was applied to characterize commercial azurite pigments, as well as blank and aged dosimeters. Results show the crucial role played by azurite particle size on protein-copper complex formation, which governed physico-chemical properties of paints and their aging behavior under different light-aging conditions. On UV-aged dosimeters, finer particles promoted stronger binder structural changes, inducing more severe color changes ($\Delta$E = 6–17). Azurite size also controlled crack formation which was more severe as pigment grain increased due to greater accumulation of binder in inter-pore spaces. Outdoor exposure caused important binder loss (50–60{\%}) and initial transformation of azurite into malachite. Since analyzed pigment composition and particle size differed from manufacturer data, we recommend their characterization prior to use in conservation works and scientific studies. Based on these results, paints made of coarse azurite particles are preferable since they are less prone to color change. Moreover, a small addition of fine-grained pigments might reduce crack development upon aging.},

abstract = {Azurite [Cu2+3(CO3)2(OH)2] and malachite [Cu2+2(CO3)(OH)2] are both monoclinic hydroxy carbonates of copper. The Raman spectra of these two minerals were collected at both 298 and 77 K together with the single crystal Raman spectra of azurite at 298 K. The spectra of both azurite and malachite contain modes of three separate vibrational groups: OH, CO3 and Cu-O. Accordingly, for azurite the bands at 3453 and 3427 cm-1 have been assigned as the O-H stretching mode with the O-H bending modes found at 1035 and 952 cm-1. Malachite displays two hydroxyl stretching bands at 3474 and 3404 cm-1 at 298 K which shift to 3470 and 3400 cm-1 at 77 K while O-H out-of-plane bending modes are found at 1045 and 875 cm-1. For the carbonate group, bands are observed at 1090 cm-1 ($\nu$1), 837 and 817 cm-1 ($\nu$2) 1490 and 1415 cm-1 ($\nu$3) and 769 and 747 cm-1 ($\nu$4). The effect of collecting the spectra at 77 K results in considerable band narrowing. The Raman spectra of the single crystals of azurite show the orientation dependence of the vibrational modes. A mechanism for $\nu$2 splitting is proposed whereby vertical carbonate ions couple to form an in-phase and out-of-phase bending modes. Combination of these vibrational modes such as $\nu$1 + $\nu$3, $\nu$1 + $\nu$3, $\nu$1 + $\nu$4 and 2$\nu$2 are found at 2530, 2414, 1860, and 1670 cm-1, respectively. IR bands for the Cu-O stretching modes are observed at 495 and 400 cm-1, while Cu-O bending modes occur at 455 and 345 cm-1. Bands at 305 and 240 cm-1 are assigned to the O-Cu-OH bending modes. The Raman out-of-plane bending modes are found at 194 and 170 cm-1. For the carbonate group, infrared bands are observed at 1095 cm-1 ($\nu$1), 834 and 816 cm-1($\nu$2), 1430 and 1419 cm-1 ($\nu$3) and 764 and 739 cm-1 ($\nu$4). Combination of the CO3 vibrational modes $\nu$1 + $\nu$4 is observed at 1860 cm-1. IR bands for Cu-O stretching modes are observed at 580, 570 and 505 cm-1.

abstract = {Recently, archaeologists have become increasingly interested in the study of visual relationships within past landscapes and buildings. However, our approaches and techniques of visual analysis often apply modern ways of thinking about sight and space to the pre-modern past, thereby ignoring important debates in other disciplines about the historicity of these concepts. Using the case studies of two schemes of medieval wall paintings in Pickering church (North Yorkshire) and the Guild Chapel, Stratford-upon-Avon, England, this paper argues that archaeologists should engage more critically with this issue. Throughout, the idea of a 'palimpsest' is used, both as a metaphor for the physical layers of plaster which overlie medieval wall paintings and as an analogy for the process of archaeological interpretation itself.},

@article{Keller,
abstract = {A new political practice, the 'reason of state', informed the ends and practices of natural study in the late sixteenth century. Informed by the study of the Roman historian Tacitus, political writers gathered 'secrets of empire' from both history and travel. Following the economic reorientation of 'reason of state' by Giovanni Botero (1544-1617), such secrets came to include bodies of useful particulars concerning nature and art collected by an expanding personnel of intelligencers. A comparison between various writers describing wide-scale collections, such as Botero, Francis Bacon (1561-1626), Jakob Bornitz (1560-1625) and Matthias Bernegger (1582-1640), reveals that seventeenth-century natural intelligencers across Europe not only were analogous to political intelligencers, but also were sometimes one and the same. Those seeking political prudence cast themselves as miners, prying precious particulars from the recesses of history, experience and disparate disciplines, including mathematics, alchemy and natural philosophy. The seventeenth-century practice of combining searches for secrets of empire, nature and art contests a frequent historiographical divide between empirical science and Tacitism or reason of state. It also points to the ways political cunning shaped the management of information for both politics and the study of nature and art. {\textcopyright} 2012 British Society for the History of Science.},

To complement the information, Py/GC/MS and GC/MS techniques were applied in order to characterize the binding media and organic materials present as well as their degradation products. Results contribute to a better understanding of the decay of blue areas in ancient paintings not only from the particular point of view of azurite weathering, but also by adding information regarding the oxalates' formation and their distribution in painting samples. Synchrotron radiation demonstrates its capability for the mapping in painting cross sections. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2010.},

abstract = {Lapis lazuli is one of the oldest precious stone, being used for glyptic as early as 7,000 years ago: jewels, amulets, seals, and inlays are examples of objects produced using this material. Only a few sources of lapis lazuli exist in the world due to the low probability of geological conditions in which it can form, so that the possibility to associate the raw material to man-made objects helps to reconstruct trade routes. Since art objects produced using lapis lazuli are valuable, only nondestructive investigations can be carried out to identify the provenance of the raw materials. Ionoluminescence (IL) is a good candidate for this task. Similar to cathodoluminescence (CL), IL consists in the collection of luminescence spectra induced by megaelectronvolt ion (usually protons) irradiation. The main advantage of IL consists in the possibility of working in air while measuring simultaneously the composition of major and trace elements by means of complementary ion beam analysis techniques like particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) or particle-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE). In the present work, a systematic study of the luminescence properties of lapis lazuli under charged particle irradiation is reported. In the first phase, a multitechnique approach was adopted (CL, scanning electron microscopy with microanalysis, micro-Raman) to characterize luminescent minerals. This characterization was propaedeutic for IL/PIXE/PIGE measurements carried out on significant areas selected on the basis of results obtained previously. Criteria to identify provenance of lapis lazuli from four of the main sources (Afghanistan, Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan, Chile, and Siberia) were proposed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

The test paintings act as dosimeters and integrate the contributions from a range of factors which determine the overall environmental hazard to which paintings are exposed. Subsequent analysis of the test paintings involved an interdisciplinary approach using mass spectrometry (FOM Institute, the Netherlands), thermal analysis (Birkbeck College, UK) and non-invasive spectroscopic analysis (CNR-IROE, Italy). These techniques gave a measure of the physicochemical change and hence the resulting damage. In this paper, the thermoanalytical data will be presented, in particular of smalt tempera Prior accelerated ageing of similar test paintings using controlled conditions was also performed to provide a comparison between artificial and natural ageing and a means for calibrating the test paintings.

abstract = {Lapis lazuli has been used for glyptics and carving since the fifth millennium BC to produce jewels, amulets, seals, inlays, etc; the identification of the origin of the stone used for carving artworks may be valuable for reconstructing old trade routes. Since ancient lapis lazuli art objects are precious, only non-destructive techniques can be used to identify their provenance, and ion beam analysis (IBA) techniques allow us to characterise this stone in a fully non-invasive way. In addition, by using an ion microprobe, we have been able to focus the analysis on single crystals, as their typical dimensions may range from a few microns to hundreds of microns. Provenance markers, identified in previous IBA studies and already presented elsewhere, were based on the presence/absence of mineral phases, on the presence/quantity of trace elements inside a phase and on characteristic features of the luminescence spectra. In this work, a systematic study on pyrite crystals, a common accessory mineral in lapis lazuli, was carried out, following a multi-technique approach: optical microscopy and SEM-EDX to select crystals for successive trace element micro-PIXE measurements at two Italian facilities, the INFN Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro and the INFN LABEC laboratory in Firenze. The results of this work allowed us to obtain new markers for lapis lazuli provenance identification. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Clinoatacamite should replace most previously reported occurrences of paratacamite in the conse literature. The nature of the reactions in 'bronze disease' is described, and the importance of copper( ride in this process is emphasized. Calumetite and other potentially important chloride species such as c lite are discussed in relation to their occurrence as corrosion products on ancient bronze objects.

abstract = {We present trace-element and composition analysis of azurite pigments in six illuminated manuscript leaves, dating from the thirteenth to sixteenth century, using synchrotron-based, large-area x-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) and diffraction (SR-XRD) mapping. SR-XRF mapping reveals several trace elements correlated with azurite, including arsenic, zirconium, antimony, barium, and bismuth, that appear in multiple manuscripts but were not always detected by point XRF. Within some manuscript leaves, variations in the concentration of trace elements associated with azurite coincide with distinct regions of the illuminations, suggesting systematic differences in azurite preparation or purification. Variations of the trace element concentrations in azurite are greater among different manuscript leaves than the variations within each individual leaf, suggesting the possibility that such impurities reflect distinct mineralogical/geologic sources. SR-XRD maps collected simultaneously with the SR-XRF maps confirm the identification of azurite regions and are consistent with impurities found in natural mineral sources of azurite. In general, our results suggest the feasibility of using azurite trace element analysis for provenance studies of illuminated manuscript fragments, and demonstrate the value of XRF mapping in non-destructive determination of trace element concentrations within a single pigment.},

abstract = {The long-term programme of technical examination conducted at the National Gallery, London, during cataloguing of the Netherlandish School paintings surveyed the materials and techniques of a wide range of artists, including not only Van Eyck, Van der Weyden, Bosch, Bruegel, Massys and Gossaert but also lesser known painters from the same period. The research presented in this article brings together both published and unpublished results from this project, strengthening the trends that had been emerging and bringing new insights into the development of artists' materials over this period. A notable finding during the programme was the discovery of two paint additives-colourless powdered glass and zinc sulphate (white vitriol)-probably added as driers. The new quantitative analyses of the glass composition presented here add to those already published, and reveal that towards the end of the fifteenth century high lime-low alkali glass begins to be used. This observation holds the potential to contribute to questions about the dating of Netherlandish paintings. A smaller number of occurrences of zinc sulphate were identified suggesting that it was less common than glass as an additive, but it is nevertheless significant since it was used by a key figure in the history of oil painting, Jan van Eyck, and occasionally, where present in excess, has caused conservation problems such as drying defects in the paint. Occurrences of the unusual pigments vivianite and fluorite were identified in a few sixteenth-century works. The main changes encountered during the period, however, were the introduction of the blue pigment smalt, its instability having consequences for the current appearance of the paintings, and of a green copper mineral pigment composed of mainly copper sulphate. The latter has proved to be far more common than had been realised in the past.},

This essay argues that there were a variety of color recipes in early modern manuals on fireworks, though the nature and value of color in displays differed quite significantly from later periods. Color was used in pyrotechny in production practices, and carried alchemical, medical and other associations. Colored fire was not the principal or exclusive location of color in early modern displays which gave much weight to colorfully painted scenery, decorations and costumes. That modern authors place so much emphasis on colored fire is due to the promotion of color in pyrotechny by writers working in the age of the Chemical Revolution.},
