\section[Preparation of samples]{Preparation of pigment samples}
\label{section2.1}

Reference samples were acquired from Dr. Spike Bucklow from the Hamilton Kerr Institute collection and Dr. Andrea Kirkham from her sample library. All reference samples were loose powder and are described qualitatively in Table \ref{table:ref_sample}. Samples are pictured in storage in \textit{Figures \ref{fig:sample_bags}} and \textit{\ref{fig:sample_vials}}, and pressed on slides for confocal Raman analysis in \textit{Figure \ref{fig:sample_slides}}.

Prior to Raman analysis, small quantities of each pigment were pressed onto double-sided sellotape and smoothed using a metal spatula. Prior to SEM-EDS analysis, small quantities of each pigment were pressed onto high purity conductive double-sided adhesive carbon tabs to minimise surface charging.

Pigment samples were also embedded in resin and polished to create a flat, uniform surface for Raman mapping and AFM analysis. A small quantity of pigment was placed in a coin shaped mold and a clear polyester resin (Tiranti clear casting resin) was poured over the pigment. The resin was allowed to set for 48 hours before being removed from the mold. Samples were filed to approximately 5 mm in height and the pigment containing surface was polished using three sequential grit sizes of silicon carbide paper (English Abrasives) and polishing cloth (Buehler), using a fine grade cerium oxide polishing powder (Beckman-RIIC) in ethanol. Finally, polished samples were cleaned with ethanol to remove extra polish and debris prior to analysis.

\section[Analysis of pigment particles by Raman spectroscopy]{Analysis of pigment particles by Raman spectroscopy}
\label{section2.2}

Collection of Raman spectra of pigment samples was done using a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution confocal Raman spectrometer with a 50x microscope objective (Olympus LMPLFLN), a 600 grooves/mm grating, and a CCD array (1024x1024 pixels). The pinhole size was 100 $\mu$m. An laser with excitation wavelength of 532 nm (diode-pumped solid-state, Laser Quantum) was selected based on optimal signal to noise ratio with lack of sample damage. We expect that the samples under consideration in this study, azurite and malachite, will show strong signals at 532 nm based on previous work on these materials.(CITE BICCHIERI) Two other excitation wavelengths, 633 nm and 785 nm, were also tested and found to give inferior results at longer acquisition times and/or higher laser powers at the sample surface. Spectra were collected in the confocal mode focusing on specific pigment grains.

Optimal collection parameters were determined to maximise the signal to noise ratio of spectra while avoiding sample damage and minimising collection times. The damage threshold of pigment grains was observed to depend on the sample identity and the size of the grain sampled. This has been observed in previous studies and is expected.(CITE PIGMENT SIZE STUDIES) Damage to azurite (blue bice, blue verditer) samples was observed to occur at 50\% power or XXXX mW with an acquisition time of 10 s and 10 accumulations. Malachite (green verditer) has a lower damage threshold, occurring at at 25\% power or XXXX mW with an acquisition time of 10 s and 10 accumulations. 10\% power or XXXX mW with an acquisition time of 10 s and 10 accumulations did not cause observable damage to any reference sample. For the sake of consistency, this lower surface power and acquisition time was selected for all samples as it gave a satisfactory signal quality.

Raman spectra were processed using OriginPro 2017 software. All spectra were fit to a spline baseline and normalised to the peak intensity at XXXX cm\textsuperscript{-1}, selected based on \mynote{XXXX fill details in here.}

\section[Analysis of pigment particles by SEM-EDS]{Analysis of pigment particles by SEM-EDS}
\label{section2.3}

Pigment particle shape, size, and regularity, as well as elemental composition, were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Samples were prepared as described in section \ref{section2.1}. Micrographs of pigments were collected at several magnifications rangeing from 250x to 2500x using a JEOL JSM-5510LV scanning electron microscope, imaged using the secondary electron detector. The working distance between the sample and the beam source was 20 mm. The accelerating voltage was 10 keV, which caused minimal charging on the surface of the sample, unless otherwise noted. ED spectra were collected at the same time as SEM imaging using an Oxford instruments probe (add specs) and (add type) detector and processed using XXXX software. The accelerating voltage was 10 keV unless otherwise noted, which limited detection of heavier elements but minimized surface charging. Elemental mapping using EDS was also carried out to detect variation between pigment grains within the same sample and identify local differences.
