abstract = {Enhancing the sulfidization of copper oxide minerals has been widely studied to improve flotation recovery. In this study, we investigated azurite surface modification with lead ions and its effects on the adsorption of sulfide ions and xanthate species on the surface with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), zeta potential measurements, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet (UV) adsorption analysis, and micro-flotation tests. In the azurite–Pb(NO3)2 system (pH 8.5–9.5), XPS and ToF-SIMS analyses showed lead ions can adsorb on to the azurite surface, forming Pb-O species. In the azurite–Pb(NO3)2–Na2S system, XPS results showed that some Pb-O species formed on the Pb(II)-treated azurite surface. The analysis also detected Pb-S species after further treatment with Na2S and demonstrated that most Cu(II) species were reduced to Cu(I) species, which assisted xanthate adsorption on to the surface and improved surface hydrophobicity. The zeta potential results indicated that lead ions can chemisorb on the azurite surface and promote its interaction with sulfide ions. The FT-IR and UV results demonstrated that the adsorption of xanthate on the azurite surface was greatly increased after the addition of lead ions and before sulfidization of the surface with Na2S. Micro-flotation results showed that the azurite flotation recovery improved after the surface was modified with lead ions before sulfidization. Therefore, lead ions had a positive influence on the sulfidization flotation of azurite.},

abstract = {Glazes add value to ceramic, improve its appearance (colour and shine) and make it waterproof. Through the choice of colours and designs, glazes made ceramics fashionable, even luxurious, and therefore, an object of trade. Each region and ruling dynasty developed its own style or trademark which makes them particularly suitable for dating purposes. Therefore, the study and analysis of glazes offers direct information about the acquisition of technical skills (technology), trade of specific materials (inter-regional links), migrations and the introduction/adoption of new trends. A ceramic glaze is a thin glassy layer fused to the surface of a ceramic body through firing. The interaction between the glaze and the ceramic body results in the interdiffusion of elements between both. A glaze consists mainly of an amorphous phase, but also includes bubbles, cracks and crystalline phases (undissolved compounds and crystals formed during the firing). Finally, the glazes were also decorated, and a large variety of materials and methods of applying the decorations were used. In this chapter, we present a summary of the technical characteristics of glazes (composition, microstructures and technical requirements), their discovery and use throughout history and decorative techniques. The methodology and analytical techniques to obtain the information are also discussed.},

abstract = {Using the recently developed techniques of electron tomography, we have explored the first stages of disfiguring formation of zinc soaps in modern oil paintings. The formation of complexes of zinc ions with fatty acids in paint layers is a major threat to the stability and appearance of many late 19th and early 20th century oil paintings. Moreover, the occurrence of zinc soaps in oil paintings leading to defects is disturbingly common, but the chemical reactions and migration mechanisms leading to large zinc soap aggregates or zones remain poorly understood. State-of-the-art scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy techniques, primarily developed for biological specimens, have enabled us to visualize the earliest stages of crystalline zinc soap growth in a reconstructed zinc white (ZnO) oil paint sample. In situ sectioning techniques and sequential imaging within the SEM allowed three-dimensional tomographic reconstruction of sample morphology. Improvements in the detection and discrimination of backscattered electrons enabled us to identify local precipitation processes with small atomic number contrast. The SEM images were correlated to low-dose and high-sensitivity TEM images, with high-resolution tomography providing unprecedented insight into the structure of nucleating zinc soaps at the molecular level. The correlative approach applied here to study phase separation, and crystallization processes specific to a problem in art conservation creates possibilities for visualization of phase formation in a wide range of soft materials.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the use of the atomic force microscope (AFM) and of the pulsed laser ablation as methods for morphological diagnostic with nanoscale precision of archeological artifacts and corrosive patina removal from stone artifacts. We test our methodology on stone artifacts extracted from the Church of Sotterra (located in Calabria, South Italy). The AFM microscopy was compared with different petrographic, chemical, optical and morphological analysis methods for identifying the textural characteristics, evaluating the state of preservation and formulating some hypotheses about the provenance and composition of the impurity patina located on the artifact surfaces. We demonstrate that with the nanometric precision obtained with AFM microscopy, it is possible to distinguish the different states of preservation, much better than using conventional petrographic methods. The surface's roughness is evaluated from very small artifact's fragments, reducing the coring at micrometric scale with a minimal damage to the artworks. After the diagnosis, we performed restoration tests using the pulsed laser ablation (PLA) method and compared it with the more common micro-sandblasting under dry conditions. We find that the PLA is highly effective for the removal of the surficial patina, with a control of a few hundreds of nanometers in the cleaning of surface, without introducing chemical or morphological damages to the artifacts. Moreover, PLA can be easily implemented in underwater conditions; this has the great advantage that stone and pottery artifacts for marine archeological sites do not need to be removed from the site.},

abstract = {Scientific imaging of a large fragile work of art can be especially challenging, but especially rewarding to better grasp the complexity and changes that have occurred during its creation and lifetime. Here, noninvasive imaging, macro X-ray fluorescence (MAXRF) imaging spectroscopy and reflectance imaging spectroscopy, from the visible to the near infrared spectral range, are utilized to document a 14-m-long Japanese narrative handscroll, The Miraculous Interventions of Jizō Bosatsu. Due to the scroll's age and its handling during past use as a teaching tool, it has a number of conservation needs and shows evidence of past repairs. The scroll has extensive and severe creasing, breaks and tears, as well as unstable and powdering pigments. Microscopic observation and scientific analyses were performed both to document the current condition of the scroll and to better understand its long history. Combining RIS and MAXRF allowed for pigment characterization through elemental and molecular information. While RIS and MAXRF previously have been applied to the study of other painted materials, their application to East Asian paintings is rare. The obstacles of the scroll's length and fragile uneven surface were overcome by optimizing the setups of the two imaging systems. The MAXRF and RIS analyses, here focused on a select scene of the scroll, found certain original pigments common in early Japanese scroll paintings were used frequently, such as vermilion, iron-based compounds (yellow and red ochres), and copper-containing greens, while others occurred sparingly, such as azurite and red lead. A chloride-containing lead-based white pigment was employed. Faded organic colorants, notably indigo as well as an organic yellow/brown, could be detected but their vibrancy has been muted over the centuries. In the case of indigo, it may be visibly observed in some areas; however, analysis revealed its previously unknown presence mixed with a copper green in a select area. This focused study sets a foundation for further studies on both this object and other Asian works of art. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

abstract = { A recently developed micrometer-scale spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (micro-SORS) method provides a new analytical capability for investigating nondestructively the chemical composition of subsurface, micrometer-scale-thick, diffusely scattering layers at depths beyond the reach of conventional confocal Raman microscopy. Here we provide, for the first time, the theoretical foundations for the micro-SORS defocusing concept based on Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, we investigate a defocusing variant of micro-SORS that we used in our recent proof-of-concept study in conditions involving thin, diffusely scattering layers on top of an extended, diffusely scattering substrate. This configuration is pertinent, for example, for the subsurface analysis of painted layers in cultural heritage studies. The depth of the origin of Raman signal and the relative micro-SORS enhancement of the sublayer signals reached are studied as a function of layer thickness, sample photon transport length, and absorption. The model predicts that sublayer enhancement initially rapidly increases with increasing defocusing, ultimately reaching a plateau. The magnitude of the enhancement was found to be larger for thicker layers. The simulations also indicate that the penetration depths of micro-SORS can be between one and two orders of magnitude larger than those reached using conventional confocal Raman microscopy. The model provides a deeper insight into the underlying Raman photon migration mechanisms permitting the more effective optimization of experimental conditions for specific sample parameters. },

@article{everall_time_resolved_SORS,
abstract = { It has been known for many years that it should be possible to discriminate between Raman and fluorescence phenomena on the basis of their differing temporal responses. However, it is only relatively recently that optical technology has advanced sufficiently to achieve the necessary combination of high repetition rate and picosecond laser pulses, coupled with gateable multichannel detectors with matched repetition rates and short on-times. Both electronic and optical gating technologies have been shown to significantly improve the Raman spectra of highly fluorescent solutions. However, the performance of such systems with solid materials has not been reported in detail. To partially redress this imbalance, this article describes the ps-time-resolved Raman spectroscopy of solid films and powders. Excellent temporal resolution and fluorescence rejection was obtained with homogeneous films, but with powders, multiple scattering has the potential to significantly blur the time resolution. For example, after incidence of a 1-ps pulse on a powdered sample of trans-stilbene, the Rayleigh signal was spread over 100 ps in time and the Raman signal persisted for more than 300 ps. Simple models are presented that predict these temporal responses on the assumption that photons randomly diffuse through the powder, scattering at particle boundaries and sometimes reemerging to be detected at a later time. These dynamics imply that fluorescence rejection with bulk powders might be less effective than with homogeneous solids as the broadened Raman signal would be incompletely captured within the short detector on period. The fluorescence would be rejected, but so would the Raman signal (to some extent), giving a poor signal-to-noise ratio. This long-term signal persistence could also complicate the interpretation of pump-probe spectroscopy studies. However, further work is needed to assess the practical implications of these findings. },

abstract = {The freshness of virgin olive oils (VOO) from typical cultivars of Garda regions was evaluated by attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, in combination with multivariate analysis. The olive oil freshness decreased during storage mainly because of oxidation processes. In this research, 91 virgin olive oils were packaged in glass bottles and stored either in the light or in the dark at room temperature for different periods. The oils were analysed, before and after storage, using both chemical methods and spectroscopic technique. Classification strategies investigated were partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA). The results show that ATR-MIR spectroscopy is an interesting technique compared with traditional chemical index in classifying olive oil samples stored in different conditions. In fact, the FTIR PCA results allowed a better discrimination among fresh and oxidized oils, than samples separation obtained by PCA applied to chemical data. Moreover, the results obtained by the different classification techniques (PLS-DA, LDA, SIMCA) evidenced the ability of FTIR spectra to evaluate the olive oil freshness. FTIR spectroscopy results are in agreement with classical methods. The spectroscopic technique could be applied for the prediction of VOOs freshness giving information related to chemical modifications. The great advantages of this technique, compared to chemical analysis, are related to rapidity, non-destructive characteristics and low cost per sample. In conclusion, ATR-MIR represents a reliable, cheap and fast classification tool able to assess the freshness of virgin olive oils.},

Triterpenes of mastic gum are considered responsible for its anti-microbial and anti-H. Pylori properties. In the present study Supercritical Fluid Extraction parameters were fine-tuned through several trials aiming at a stepwise, efficient and environmentally friendly methodology, resulting to the extraction and enrichment of the valuable groups of constituents of mastic gum: a volatile fraction, a triterpenic fraction further separated in neutral and acidic, as well as a resinous polymer. GC-MS analysis, revealed the dominance of {\^{I}}±-pinene and trans-verbenol in the volatile fraction and of caryophyllene oxide, mastihadienonic and oleanonic aldehyde among others in the neutral triterpenes fraction. HR-MS/MS analysis was implemented for the characterization of the triterpenic acid fraction, revealing the dominance of isomasticadienonic, masticadienonic, oleanonic and moronic acid.},

abstract = {Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been used to study samples taken from three paintings during treatment in the Conservation Department of the Tate Gallery. The paintings include two from the 16th century: (1) Queen Elizabeth 1 by Nicholas Hilliard (National Portrait Gallery, London NPG 190), (2) An Allegory of Life (unattributed ca. 1570 British School To 5729) and (3) 19th century, Turner's The Opening of the Walhalla, 1842 (Tate Gallery N00533). Knowledge of the type of paint media used is of interest both to the conservator who needs to select the appropriate materials for cleaning the painting and to the art historian for documentation of artists' techniques. In the case of the Hilliard painting it was found that a mixed oil egg medium had been used. With regard to the unattributed 16th century British painting it was found that an oil-based medium had been used. The ground layer contained, as expected, a natural glue. Samples from the Turner painting showed that different regions of the painting had been executed with different materials; the region of the sky was painted predominantly with a drying oil, the lower regions of the painting contained mixtures of oil and resin and in some cases the samples were further complicated by the presence of proteinaceous material and wax. The recorded accompanying weight change gave information on the pigment volume concentration of the samples. In each case measurements were made of both the temperature and the heat evolved during the exothermic reactions. Thermomicroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the presence of complex mixtures, particularly in the case of the Turner samples.},

abstract = {One of the most suitable analytical techniques used for edible oil quality control is Fourier transform mid infrared spectroscopy (FT-MIR). FT-MIR spectroscopy was used to continuously characterize the aging of various edible oils thanks to a specific aging cell. There were differences in the spectra of fresh and aged oils from different vegetable sources, which provide the basis of a method to classify them according to the oxidative spectroscopic index value. The use of chemometric treatment such as multivariate curve resolution-alternative least square (MCR-ALS) made it possible to extract the spectra of main formed and degraded species. The concentration profiles gave interesting information about the ability of the various oils to support the oxidative treatment and showed that all oils present the same aging process. Both methods led to concordant results in terms of induction times determined by the oxidative spectroscopic index and the appearance of oxidation products revealed by MCR-ALS.},

The frequencies of the extremes in a difference spectrum do not correspond to the actual band maximum frequencies in the original spectra when the frequency difference of the two bands is less than 150 percent of the band halfwidth (Hw). In order to alleviate frequency distortions, an application of even derivatives (second and fourth derivatives) of the difference spectrum is proposed. The intensity of the corresponding bands before subtraction can be calculated from the known band frequency and the halfwidth estimated from the difference spectrum. The original calculated intensity may serve as an indicator of the band structure. The calculated band parameters (intensity, frequency, and halfwidth) may further serve as reliable initial values for the band fitting algorithm applied to the original and/or difference spectrum.},

The concept is demonstrated by recovering the pure Raman spectra of paint sub-layers that are completely obscured by paint over-layers.

abstract = {This paper presents an analytical investigation of paint reconstructions prepared with linseed oil that have undergone typical 19th century treatments in preparation for painting. The oil was mechanically extracted from the same seed lot, which was then processed by various methods: water washing, heat treatments, and the addition of driers, with and without heat. A modern process lead white (Dutch source, Schoonhoven) and a commercially available vine black were used as pigments. The reconstructions were prepared in 1999, and naturally aged from then onwards. We compared thermogravimetric analysis (TG), which yields macromolecular information, with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and direct exposure mass spectrometry (DEMS), which both provide molecular information. The study enabled us to quantitatively demonstrate, for the first time, that the parameters used to identify drying oils are deeply influenced by the history of the paint. In particular, here we show that the ratio between the relative amounts of palmitic and stearic acid (P/S), which is used as an index for differentiating between drying oils, is extremely dependent on the pigments present and the age of the paint. Moreover the study revealed that neither the P/S parameter nor the ratios between the relative amounts of the various dicarboxylic acids (azelaic over suberic and azelaic over sebacic) can be used to trace the sorts of pre-treatment undergone by the oil investigated in this study. The final results represent an important milestone for the scientific community working in the field, highlighting that further research is still necessary to solve the identification of drying oils in works of art.},

Data are affected by the mutual influence effects of the chemical elements that characterize mineral pigments, by the sequence and the thickness of the paint layers in the stratigraphies and by the size of pigment grains. Sequences of pictorial layers, which produce the typical stratigraphy of cold-painted terracotta and wooden sculptures, have been prepared and then analysed by means of two portable X-ray spectrometers: Innov X Systems Alpha 4000 (Tantalum X-ray tube, 40 kV and 7 {\^{A}}µA) and Assing Lithos 3000 (Molybdenum X-ray tube, 25 kV and 300 {\^{A}}µA). For each layer of pigment, the XRF spectrum was acquired and the areas of K and L peaks of characterizing elements were calculated. Moreover, the thickness of the layers was determined using XRF data following an algorithm already shown and the values have been compared with those measured on polished cross sections observed by optical microscope in reflected light.

Band target entropy minimization (BTEM) is used to recover the spectra of the subsurface components and generate maps of their distributions. This approach to subsurface mapping is tested with model systems consisting of two or three layers of polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), and polyoxymethylene (Delrin) arranged in different geometries. Raman spectra and maps were obtained through overlayer thicknesses of up to 13 mm. Subsurface spatial resolution is achieved because each fiber views an asymmetric distribution of Raman scattered light from surface and subsurface components that depends on the position of the fiber relative to the depth and position of a component and the extent of photon diffusion through the system. },

The as-deposited films were heat treated at different temperatures and the effects of heat treatment on structural modifications were studied in detail by Raman spectroscopy through the evolution of D and G bands. The spectral evolution observed on heat treated samples show progressive formation of crystallites. These structural changes were further correlated with optical gap and fraction of sp3 bonded carbons present, derived respectively from uv visible and photoelectron spectroscopies, and the results obtained are discussed and compared with the literature.},

Spectra acquired in the range 300–500nm during 12h accelerated oxidation stress using a surface per volume ratio of 0.95cm2ml−1 reveal five different classes after PCA. Parallel monitoring of lipid oxidation parameters peroxide value (PV), anisidine value (AV) shows that after 12h, TOTOX value increases 10-fold, 19-fold and almost 38-fold for extra virgin olive, olive and olive-pomace oil, respectively. Linear correlations between parameter values versus exposure time were observed during extra virgin olive oil deterioration under UV at different temperatures: ambient (∼20°C), 40, 60 and 80°C. The rate of increase was found to be 6.3, 18.7, 37 and 56 TOTOX h−1, 2.8, 8.3, 16.5 and 25.6meq peroxides kg−1h−1 and 0.84, 2.0, 3.6 and 4.9AVh−1, respectively.

abstract = {Ion beam analysis (IBA) techniques play an important role in the field of cultural heritage. IBA was one of the first physical methods applied to archaeology in the 70s. 40years later, more than 25 accelerator laboratories were or are involved in cultural heritage applications. The advantages of the IBA techniques match very well the requirements for the analysis of archaeological or museum objects: non destructiveness, major, minor and trace element analysis, information in depth, elemental mapping. Thanks to this collected information, IBA techniques can answer archaeological and conservation questions: provenance determination, ancient technologies (fabrication, transformation, recipes) and conservation issues. In spite of the competition with portable devices and large facilities (such as synchrotron or neutron reactors), the IBA methods keep their interest due to the possibility of associating two or three of them according to the archaeological or art issue. In this article, some examples chosen for their original approach are presented: PIXE for X-radiography, provenance of prehistoric pigments and painting characterisation. They illustrate the useful versatility of IBA for cultural heritage studies. Perspectives for further improvements are also proposed.},

The results from CA, PCA and LDA indicated that the E-nose technique could be used for differentiation of non-oxidized and oxidized oils. LDA produced slightly better results than CA and PCA.

Multivariate curve resolution (MCR) method found three spectral components in the NIR and MIR spectral matrix, corresponding to the oxidation products, and saturated and unsaturated structures. Good quantitative relation was found between peroxide value and contribution of oxidation products evaluated using MCR – based on NIR (R2=0.890), MIR (R2=0.707) and combined NIR and MIR (R2=0.747) data.

abstract = {Up to now, among the IBA techniques, only PIXE has been used for analyzing paintings. However, quantitative PIXE analysis is sometimes difficult to interpret due to the layered structure, the presence of varnish and organic binder and, in some cases, discoloration of the pigments has been observed due to the interaction of the ion beam with the compounds. In order to improve the characterization of paintings, we propose some alternative experimental procedures. First of all, backscattering spectrometry (BS) and PIXE are simultaneously combined in order to collect complementary information such as layer thickness and organic compound quantification. The simultaneous PIXE and BS experiments also have the advantage of being able to analyze the same area in one experiment. This combination, implemented with an external beam, was directly applied on paintings and on painting cross-sections for the study of Italian Renaissance masterpieces. We have obtained valuable results not only on the pigment itself but also, for the first time, on the binder to pigment proportion which is not well documented in the ancient recipes. Moreover, in order to restrain beam damages due to the ion stopping power, we propose to analyze very thin painting cross-sections by a combination of PIXE RBS and Scanning Transmission Ion Microscopy (STIM).},

@article{polished_conti,
abstract = {Abstract Nowadays, in order to preserve the surfaces of works of art, several organic and inorganic substances are used. To evaluate the penetration depth and the distribution of these substances inside the materials, it is essential to define the effectiveness of a conservative treatment. Owing to the ambiguous results obtained with the current analytical techniques, the achievement of this aim is critical. This study shows how micro-Raman mapping on polished cross section is an effective tool capable of investigating the inner portions of the materials. A set of painted plasters has been treated with ammonium oxalate solutions, an inorganic substance widely used for conservation works of carbonatic materials. The micro-Raman mapping of the lines of the newly formed calcium oxalate allowed correlation of the penetration depth and the distribution of the product inside the specimens with different conditions of treatment. Moreover, a good agreement between micro-Raman spectroscopy and microscopic techniques has been obtained. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The G and 2D Raman peaks change in shape, position and relative intensity with number of graphene layers. This reflects the evolution of the electronic structure and electron-phonon interactions. We then consider the effects of doping on the Raman spectra of graphene. The Fermi energy is tuned by applying a gate-voltage. We show that this induces a stiffening of the Raman G peak for both holes and electrons doping. Thus Raman spectroscopy can be efficiently used to monitor number of layers, quality of layers, doping level and confinement.},

The model was able to reproduce the key observations made from the first SORS experiments, namely the dependence of Raman signal intensities on the spatial offset between the illumination and collection points and the relative contributions to the overall spectrum from the top layer and sub-layer. The application of the SORS concept to a three-layer system is also discussed. The model also clearly indicates that an annular geometry, rather than a point-collection geometry, which was used in the earlier experiments, would yield much improved data. },

abstract = {A variety of lac resin samples obtained from artists suppliers, industrial manufacturers, and museum collections were analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and reactive pyrolysis GCMS with quaternary ammonium reagents. These techniques allowed a detailed chemical characterisation of microgram-sized samples, based on the detection and identification of derivatives of the hydroxy aliphatic and cyclic (sesquiterpene) acids that compose the resin. Differences in composition could be related to the nature of the resin, e.g. wax-containing (unrefined), bleached, or aged samples. Furthermore, differences in the relative abundances of aliphatic hydroxyacids appear to be associated with the biological source of the resin. The diagnostic value of newly characterised lac components, including 8-hydroxyacids, is discussed here for the first time. Identification of derivatised components was aided by AMDIS deconvolution software, and discrimination of samples was enhanced by statistical evaluation of data using principal component analysis. The robustness of the analyses, together with the minimal sample size required, make these very powerful approaches for the characterisation of lac resin in museum objects. The value of such analyses for enhancing the understanding of museum collections is illustrated by two case studies of objects in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art: a restorer's varnish on a painting by Luca Signorelli, and a pictorial inlay in an early nineteenth-century High Chest by George Dyer.},

abstract = {Raman spectroscopic studies of carbonaceous materials are, until now, mainly devoted to geological and industrial materials. On the other hand, it is known from artistic literature that many varieties of carbon-based black pigments were produced and used in different places and times, and according to the artist's preferences. The ability of Raman spectroscopy to analyse particles down to 1µm and its non-destructiveness make it an ideal tool for pigments investigation. Anyway, the discrimination among different types of carbon-based black pigments is affected by various aspects, one of which is the lack of reference spectra as well as of specific nomenclature. In this paper, reference materials have been studied by means of Raman spectroscopy to provide reference spectra. All the pigments showed two broad bands of carbon, but sometimes specific excitation conditions were required to record a good quality Raman spectrum. The obtained Raman signatures are discussed, on the basis of the specificities of the pigment (natural or artificial origin; structural implications related to the raw materials used or to production processes; etc.). Therefore, on the basis of the Raman spectra of painting materials, further knowledge can be obtained on the type of carbon-based black pigments in works of art.

abstract = { We describe a simple methodology for the effective retrieval of Raman spectra of subsurface layers in diffusely scattering media. The technique is based on the collection of Raman scattered light from surface regions that are laterally offset away from the excitation laser spot on the sample. The Raman spectra obtained in this way exhibit a variation in relative spectral intensities of the surface and subsurface layers of the sample being investigated. The data set is processed using a multivariate data analysis to yield pure Raman spectra of the individual sample layers, providing a method for the effective elimination of surface Raman scatter. The methodology is applicable to the retrieval of pure Raman spectra from depths well in excess of those accessible with conventional confocal microscopy. In this first feasibility study we have differentiated between surface and subsurface Raman signals within a diffusely scattering sample composed of two layers: trans-stilbene powder beneath a 1 mm thick over-layer of PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) powder. The improvement in contrast of the subsurface trans-stilbene layer without numerical processing was 19 times. The potential applications include biomedical subsurface probing of specific tissues through different overlying tissues such as assessment of bone quality through skin, providing an effective noninvasive means of screening for bone degeneration, other skeletal disease diagnosis, and dermatology studies, as well as materials and catalyst research. },

abstract = {Indoor air pollution has caused increasing concern since the 1970s, when the advent of stricter energy efficiency measures lead to increased reports of building related symptoms. Cleaning activities have been linked to adverse health effects indoors, although it is unclear which of the components of cleaning products cause these reported health effects. This paper uses a detailed chemical model for indoor air chemistry, to identify the species formed at the highest concentrations following use of a limonene-based cleaning product. The explicit nature of the chemical mechanism also permits the key pathways to their formation to be identified. The results show that the key species in terms of gas-phase concentration are multi-functional carbonyl species including limonaldehyde, 4-acetyl-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene and other dicarbonyl species. The particle-phase was dominated by peroxide species. The predicted gas-phase concentrations for three limonene-oxidation products were compared to recently published human reference values, but found not to be high enough to cause concern for typical indoor conditions, or under high indoor ozone conditions. However, cleaning products contain a range of terpenes other than limonene, which could also produce some of the secondary products identified here, as well as more common species such as formaldehyde, glyoxal and hydrogen peroxide. A mechanistic pathway analysis shows that the secondary products formed through limonene oxidation indoors depend critically on the competition between ozone and hydroxyl radicals, such that indoor pollutant concentrations and composition could vary widely in different locations for a nominally similar residence and indoor activities. Future studies should focus on aiming to measure multi-functional carbonyl species indoors to help validate models, whilst human reference values are needed for many more relevant species indoors.},

abstract = {Carbon-based black pigments are a wide group of dark-colored materials, which are classified according to the starting material used and their method of manufacture. Raman spectroscopy is an ideal technique for the characterization of carbonaceous matter: crystalline carbon materials present well-defined peaks, which can be easily assigned; amorphous carbon materials, on the other hand, show broad bands between 1300 and 1600 cm-1. The aim of this work was the discrimination between carbon-based pigments by micro-Raman spectroscopy. Five carbon-based pigments provided by Zecchi (lampblack, ivory black, bistre, bitumen, and graphite), two humic-earth materials [Van Dyck (Kremer) and Earth of Kassel (Zecchi)], and a commercial wood charcoal were studied. Raman spectra of all the samples showed the characteristic bands at approximately 1580 and 1350 cm-1; however, a clear difference in position, width, and relative intensity could be observed for most of the samples. The resulting analysis showed that micro-Raman spectroscopy allowed the discrimination of most of the reference pigments and allowed the identification of carbon-based black pigments in two South American colonial paintings dated from the early 18th century.

abstract = {A computer program is proposed for the decomposition of spectra into their constituent Gaussian peaks. A new feature of this program is the possibility of operating on different spectra from two or more components of variable concentration at the same time, by optimising the wavelengths of the maxima and the halfbandwidths of all the spectra while the height of each peak is optimized in each single spectrum. This distinct treatment is possible due to the fact that the Gaussian functions are linear with respect to the heights and non-linear with respect to the remaining parameters. A linear and non-linear least-squares analysis, respectively, is therefore possible. Besides its intrinsic utility in handling spectral data of different origin this procedure proves more useful than the single spectrum decomposition both in increasing the reliability of the parameters and in improving the convergence properties of the procedure.},

abstract = {Thermooxidation at 100{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C and photooxidation at wavelengths above 300 nm of dried oil films were evaluated. The chemical modifications of the networks were determined by infrared analysis coupled with gaseous treatments (NO, SF4, and NH3). The dried films are rather stable in thermooxidation, whereas in photooxidation, important degradation of the network occurs with many chain scissions. This photoinstability results from the presence of crosslinks that are sensitive to radical attack because of the lability of the hydrogen atom on the tertiary carbons. The photooxidation reactions are fully described in this paper. Yellowing of the cured samples, observed with ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence spectrometries, rapidly is decreased by irradiation because the oil contaminants that are mainly responsible for the yellowness are photooxidized. On the contrary, yellowing slowly but continuously increases during thermooxidation at 100{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C.},

abstract = { Spectral fingerprinting, as a method of discriminating between plant cultivars and growing treatments for a common set of broccoli samples, was compared for six analytical instruments. Spectra were acquired for finely powdered solid samples using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Fourier transform near-infrared (NIR) spectrometry. Spectra were also acquired for unfractionated aqueous methanol extracts of the powders using molecular absorption in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible (VIS) regions and mass spectrometry with negative (MS-) and positive (MS+) ionization. The spectra were analyzed using nested one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to statistically evaluate the quality of discrimination. All six methods showed statistically significant differences between the cultivars and treatments. The significance of the statistical tests was improved by the judicious selection of spectral regions (IR and NIR), masses (MS+ and MS-), and derivatives (IR, NIR, UV, and VIS). },

For this purpose, test tempera paintings were prepared and exposed at selected sites. The test paintings act as dosimeters and integrate the contributions from a range of factors which determine the overall environmental hazard to which paintings are exposed. Subsequent analysis of the test paintings involved an interdisciplinary approach using mass spectrometry (FOM Institute, the Netherlands), thermal analysis (Birkbeck College, UK) and non-invasive spectroscopic analysis (CNR-IROE, Italy). These techniques gave a measure of the physicochemical change and hence the resulting damage. In this paper, the thermoanalytical data will be presented, in particular of smalt tempera Prior accelerated ageing of similar test paintings using controlled conditions was also performed to provide a comparison between artificial and natural ageing and a means for calibrating the test paintings.

In this paper, micro-Raman and LIBS have been used for the study of azurite and lapis-lazuli, as well as different mixtures of these pigments applied to parchment to simulate an illuminated manuscript. The results of our work show the importance of using more than one technique for a good comprehension of a manuscript.

In these two works Boyle wrestles with a difficult practical and philosophical problem with experiments, which he calls the problem of contingency. In Touching Colours, the problem of contingency is magnified by the much-debated issue of whether color had any deep epistemic importance. His limited theoretical principle guiding him in Touching Colours, that color is but modified light, further exacerbated the problem. Rather than theory, Boyle often relied on craftsmen, whose mastery of color phenomena was, Boyle mentions, brought about by economic forces, to determine when colors were indicators of important 'inward' properties of substances, and thus to secure a solid foundation for his experimental history of color.},

abstract = {Nineteen natural specimens of azurite from European mining locations used in medieval times were analysed by Raman microscopy to investigate the existence and identity of any impurities. Malachite, hematite, goethite and other commonly occurring minerals such as cuprite, rutile and anatase were detected in a significant proportion of the specimens. Other minerals detected, albeit less frequently, include quartz, calcite, cerussite, orthoclase, beudantite and jarosite. These findings indicate that any iron oxides and malachite detected as minor impurities in azurite-containing museum objects should be taken as a consequence of the natural make-up of azurite specimens used for the pigments rather than a deliberate addition by the artist. Furthermore, the apparently sensible assumption that black and orange-brown impurities in azurite pigments are mainly copper oxides (cuprite and tenorite) is incorrect as these particles actually correspond to the iron oxides, goethite and hematite. It is possible with considerable further work that the concurrent association of the less common impurities within a single pigment sample might help to ascertain the provenance of an individual azurite-containing pigment by relating it to a known historic azurite source. If such a provenance study was carried out, we expect specific localization of an azurite pigment would only be possible if a source region or mine is known to contain azurite with particularly exotic or unusual composition.},

Accordingly, for azurite the bands at 3453 and 3427 cm-1 have been assigned as the O-H stretching mode with the O-H bending modes found at 1035 and 952 cm-1. Malachite displays two hydroxyl stretching bands at 3474 and 3404 cm-1 at 298 K which shift to 3470 and 3400 cm-1 at 77 K while O-H out-of-plane bending modes are found at 1045 and 875 cm-1. For the carbonate group, bands are observed at 1090 cm-1 ($\nu$1), 837 and 817 cm-1 ($\nu$2) 1490 and 1415 cm-1 ($\nu$3) and 769 and 747 cm-1 ($\nu$4). The effect of collecting the spectra at 77 K results in considerable band narrowing. The Raman spectra of the single crystals of azurite show the orientation dependence of the vibrational modes. A mechanism for $\nu$2 splitting is proposed whereby vertical carbonate ions couple to form an in-phase and out-of-phase bending modes. Combination of these vibrational modes such as $\nu$1 + $\nu$3, $\nu$1 + $\nu$3, $\nu$1 + $\nu$4 and 2$\nu$2 are found at 2530, 2414, 1860, and 1670 cm-1, respectively. IR bands for the Cu-O stretching modes are observed at 495 and 400 cm-1, while Cu-O bending modes occur at 455 and 345 cm-1. Bands at 305 and 240 cm-1 are assigned to the O-Cu-OH bending modes. The Raman out-of-plane bending modes are found at 194 and 170 cm-1. For the carbonate group, infrared bands are observed at 1095 cm-1 ($\nu$1), 834 and 816 cm-1($\nu$2), 1430 and 1419 cm-1 ($\nu$3) and 764 and 739 cm-1 ($\nu$4). Combination of the CO3 vibrational modes $\nu$1 + $\nu$4 is observed at 1860 cm-1. IR bands for Cu-O stretching modes are observed at 580, 570 and 505 cm-1.

abstract = {This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the role played by pigment particle size in pigment-binder interactions, and thus susceptibility to aging of azurite-rabbit glue paint dosimeters upon accelerated UV-aging versus outdoor sunlight exposure. A complementary multi-analytical approach, including spectroscopic and surface analytical techniques, was applied to characterize commercial azurite pigments, as well as blank and aged dosimeters. Results show the crucial role played by azurite particle size on protein-copper complex formation, which governed physico-chemical properties of paints and their aging behavior under different light-aging conditions. On UV-aged dosimeters, finer particles promoted stronger binder structural changes, inducing more severe color changes ($\Delta$E = 6–17). Azurite size also controlled crack formation which was more severe as pigment grain increased due to greater accumulation of binder in inter-pore spaces. Outdoor exposure caused important binder loss (50–60{\%}) and initial transformation of azurite into malachite. Since analyzed pigment composition and particle size differed from manufacturer data, we recommend their characterization prior to use in conservation works and scientific studies. Based on these results, paints made of coarse azurite particles are preferable since they are less prone to color change. Moreover, a small addition of fine-grained pigments might reduce crack development upon aging.},

abstract = {Wall paintings survive in many houses dating from the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries yet, apart from recording the phenomenon, there has been very little written about them. This research explores how common wall paintings were, what sort of houses had them, when they were painted and most importantly, what was their significance in terms of what they can reveal about the lives of the people who chose to decorate their homes in this manner. Research has concentrated on the Welsh Marches although examples from elsewhere have been referred to. The research hypotheses are: 1. Wall paintings were much more widespread than existing records suggest and were probably universal where there was money to spend on embellishing a house. 2. Following on from this, wall paintings would have been found in houses throughout the social scale, apart from the humblest dwellings. 3. The paintings were executed by itinerant painters who used pattern books as a source of design. 4. This form of decoration was most commonly found in the period 1550-1625, with few paintings prior to this date and a rapid decline in numbers after this period. 5. In some cases there is a connection between the content of the painting and the function of the room. The fifth hypothesis was widened during the course of the research to examine the significance of wall paintings generally. In trying to find out what wall paintings signified to the owners of houses, this research has attempted to look at all the facets of their life and environment which may have a bearing on this. This includes an understanding of the buildings themselves, exploring who the people were who might have lived in them and placing these people in their social and cultural contexts. Always the emphasis has been on the small and local rather than on the bigger picture. as this is what touched people at the vernacular level most closely. In order to do this, the research has adopted a wide-ranging and multidisciplinary approach which cuts across traditional fields of knowledge. Therefore, the study combines library and documentary-based evidence with extensive fieldwork, in order to investigate diverse kinds of evidence. This includes research on the wall paintings themselves, the buildings in which they were found and the social, religious and cultural circumstances in which they were created. The research synthesises a wide range of methods for gathering and interpreting data: study and analysis of contemporary literature and documents, the study of a wide range of published and unpublished research, and a substantial fieldwork survey. First the context in which wall paintings were created is explored, in terms of physical environment, cultural and social characteristics of the period, and the church. Then the key findings arising from the fieldwork are discussed, looking at the sorts of houses that have wall paintings, the people who lived in them, and in detail at the characteristics of the paintings found. 233 wall paintings were recorded in 188 buildings. The hypotheses about universality and status are explored by investigating the vernacular qualities of wall painting in terms of materials and techniques required, who was doing the paintings, and their cost. Through the identification of a range of iconography, and the classification of paintings, possible sources for wall painting designs are explored. Finally the key issue of the significance of painted decoration at the vernacular level is discussed drawing on the various strands of the research in order to understand why particular forms of decoration might have been chosen, and what social and cultural meanings they may have had. The findings of the research indicate that wall paintings were very widespread. They were found throughout the area of study in houses of all but the very poor. Whilst the majority of paintings surveyed were in houses of the gentry or better-off members of society it is argued that this reflects the differential rate of survival of vernacular buildings. A technical analysis of wall paintings and an assessment of their total cost reveals the vernacular qualities of the wall paintings. This also suggests that wall paintings were only ever intended as short term decoration as some of the pigments used were very fugitive. Further evidence for this has been found in the practice of overpainting one scheme with another within a short period, which was revealed through microscopic analysis of paint samples. The contemporary aesthetic included striking yet crude designs which were capable of being executed by local craftsmen. These findings indicate that wall paintings could have been extensive lower down the social scale. Whilst painted decoration throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was examined, it is submitted that the majority of paintings were executed during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries - a period of considerable change during the transition from a medieval to an early modern society. The paintings dating from this period have a character quite distinct from the limited number found earlier and later than this period. The significance of wall paintings is closely bound up with issues of status. This period of transition was characterised by outward expressions of status by means of display in a variety of forms. It is argued in this research that wall paintings were an element of such display. Iconography included decorative as well as figure subjects and it is this that holds the key to the significance of the paintings. The higher status houses had the more complex figurative and ornamental schemes whilst, for the most part, the humbler houses had simpler ornamental schemes. Also the simpler, decorative schemes seem to have been more common in halls whilst more sophisticated paintings appear to have been in the more private rooms of the house. The iconography and the context of the wall paintings can provide an important insight into some of the more intangible and elusive aspects of vernacular life. Social and cultural values of the period are particularly difficult to access as surviving indicators of these are limited. Literary sources have limited value in a society which expressed itself in a predominantly non-literate fashion. Vernacular buildings can provide a major source of information and this research argues that wall paintings were a key element in vernacular buildings at a specific time during the transition from a medieval to an early modern society and are, therefore, a crucial record of changing social and cultural values.},

abstract = {Lapis lazuli has been used for glyptics and carving since the fifth millennium BC to produce jewels, amulets, seals, inlays, etc; the identification of the origin of the stone used for carving artworks may be valuable for reconstructing old trade routes. Since ancient lapis lazuli art objects are precious, only non-destructive techniques can be used to identify their provenance, and ion beam analysis (IBA) techniques allow us to characterise this stone in a fully non-invasive way. In addition, by using an ion microprobe, we have been able to focus the analysis on single crystals, as their typical dimensions may range from a few microns to hundreds of microns. Provenance markers, identified in previous IBA studies and already presented elsewhere, were based on the presence/absence of mineral phases, on the presence/quantity of trace elements inside a phase and on characteristic features of the luminescence spectra. In this work, a systematic study on pyrite crystals, a common accessory mineral in lapis lazuli, was carried out, following a multi-technique approach: optical microscopy and SEM-EDX to select crystals for successive trace element micro-PIXE measurements at two Italian facilities, the INFN Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro and the INFN LABEC laboratory in Firenze. The results of this work allowed us to obtain new markers for lapis lazuli provenance identification. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {It has commonly been assumed that there were no colors in fireworks prior to the early nineteenth century. This essay argues that there were a variety of color recipes in early modern manuals on fireworks, though the nature and value of color in displays differed quite significantly from later periods. Color was used in pyrotechny in production practices, and carried alchemical, medical and other associations. Colored fire was not the principal or exclusive location of color in early modern displays which gave much weight to colorfully painted scenery, decorations and costumes. That modern authors place so much emphasis on colored fire is due to the promotion of color in pyrotechny by writers working in the age of the Chemical Revolution.},

abstract = {The long-term programme of technical examination conducted at the National Gallery, London, during cataloguing of the Netherlandish School paintings surveyed the materials and techniques of a wide range of artists, including not only Van Eyck, Van der Weyden, Bosch, Bruegel, Massys and Gossaert but also lesser known painters from the same period. The research presented in this article brings together both published and unpublished results from this project, strengthening the trends that had been emerging and bringing new insights into the development of artists' materials over this period. A notable finding during the programme was the discovery of two paint additives-colourless powdered glass and zinc sulphate (white vitriol)-probably added as driers. The new quantitative analyses of the glass composition presented here add to those already published, and reveal that towards the end of the fifteenth century high lime-low alkali glass begins to be used. This observation holds the potential to contribute to questions about the dating of Netherlandish paintings. A smaller number of occurrences of zinc sulphate were identified suggesting that it was less common than glass as an additive, but it is nevertheless significant since it was used by a key figure in the history of oil painting, Jan van Eyck, and occasionally, where present in excess, has caused conservation problems such as drying defects in the paint. Occurrences of the unusual pigments vivianite and fluorite were identified in a few sixteenth-century works. The main changes encountered during the period, however, were the introduction of the blue pigment smalt, its instability having consequences for the current appearance of the paintings, and of a green copper mineral pigment composed of mainly copper sulphate. The latter has proved to be far more common than had been realised in the past.},

To complement the information, Py/GC/MS and GC/MS techniques were applied in order to characterize the binding media and organic materials present as well as their degradation products. Results contribute to a better understanding of the decay of blue areas in ancient paintings not only from the particular point of view of azurite weathering, but also by adding information regarding the oxalates' formation and their distribution in painting samples. Synchrotron radiation demonstrates its capability for the mapping in painting cross sections. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2010.},

abstract = {A new political practice, the 'reason of state', informed the ends and practices of natural study in the late sixteenth century. Informed by the study of the Roman historian Tacitus, political writers gathered 'secrets of empire' from both history and travel. Following the economic reorientation of 'reason of state' by Giovanni Botero (1544-1617), such secrets came to include bodies of useful particulars concerning nature and art collected by an expanding personnel of intelligencers. A comparison between various writers describing wide-scale collections, such as Botero, Francis Bacon (1561-1626), Jakob Bornitz (1560-1625) and Matthias Bernegger (1582-1640), reveals that seventeenth-century natural intelligencers across Europe not only were analogous to political intelligencers, but also were sometimes one and the same. Those seeking political prudence cast themselves as miners, prying precious particulars from the recesses of history, experience and disparate disciplines, including mathematics, alchemy and natural philosophy. The seventeenth-century practice of combining searches for secrets of empire, nature and art contests a frequent historiographical divide between empirical science and Tacitism or reason of state. It also points to the ways political cunning shaped the management of information for both politics and the study of nature and art. {\textcopyright} 2012 British Society for the History of Science.},

abstract = {Lapis lazuli is one of the oldest precious stone, being used for glyptic as early as 7,000 years ago: jewels, amulets, seals, and inlays are examples of objects produced using this material. Only a few sources of lapis lazuli exist in the world due to the low probability of geological conditions in which it can form, so that the possibility to associate the raw material to man-made objects helps to reconstruct trade routes. Since art objects produced using lapis lazuli are valuable, only nondestructive investigations can be carried out to identify the provenance of the raw materials. Ionoluminescence (IL) is a good candidate for this task. Similar to cathodoluminescence (CL), IL consists in the collection of luminescence spectra induced by megaelectronvolt ion (usually protons) irradiation. The main advantage of IL consists in the possibility of working in air while measuring simultaneously the composition of major and trace elements by means of complementary ion beam analysis techniques like particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) or particle-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE). In the present work, a systematic study of the luminescence properties of lapis lazuli under charged particle irradiation is reported. In the first phase, a multitechnique approach was adopted (CL, scanning electron microscopy with microanalysis, micro-Raman) to characterize luminescent minerals. This characterization was propaedeutic for IL/PIXE/PIGE measurements carried out on significant areas selected on the basis of results obtained previously. Criteria to identify provenance of lapis lazuli from four of the main sources (Afghanistan, Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan, Chile, and Siberia) were proposed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {We present trace-element and composition analysis of azurite pigments in six illuminated manuscript leaves, dating from the thirteenth to sixteenth century, using synchrotron-based, large-area x-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) and diffraction (SR-XRD) mapping. SR-XRF mapping reveals several trace elements correlated with azurite, including arsenic, zirconium, antimony, barium, and bismuth, that appear in multiple manuscripts but were not always detected by point XRF. Within some manuscript leaves, variations in the concentration of trace elements associated with azurite coincide with distinct regions of the illuminations, suggesting systematic differences in azurite preparation or purification. Variations of the trace element concentrations in azurite are greater among different manuscript leaves than the variations within each individual leaf, suggesting the possibility that such impurities reflect distinct mineralogical/geologic sources. SR-XRD maps collected simultaneously with the SR-XRF maps confirm the identification of azurite regions and are consistent with impurities found in natural mineral sources of azurite. In general, our results suggest the feasibility of using azurite trace element analysis for provenance studies of illuminated manuscript fragments, and demonstrate the value of XRF mapping in non-destructive determination of trace element concentrations within a single pigment.},
