I would like to thank my supervisor Mike Casford and the rest of my lab, who have been extremely supportive of this work and offered invaluable advice in developing analytic methods and suggesting interesting research questions to investigate. I would also like to thank Dr. Spike Bucklow and Dr. Andrea Kirkham for their guidance and support of this research and their generous provision of pigment and cross section samples for analysis. Dr. Dan Pemberton at the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences has also generously helped me access mineral samples. Kate Waldron at the Hamilton Kerr Institute provided dark field microscope images that appear in this report, and her research into historical azurite preparation methods was the impetus for my research on \textit{Battle of Spurs}. I would also like to thank Sophie Casford for helping collect SEM and EDS data for several \textit{Battle of Spurs} samples.

Finally, I would also like to thank the Gates Cambridge Trust for their financial support, enabling me to undertake this research.
